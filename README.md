# AcrylicEverywhere
Upstream implementation of the [DWMBlurGlass](https://github.com/Maplespe/DWMBlurGlass) custom blur method.  
  
In theory, the custom blur method is supported as low as Windows 10 1607, but it requires a lot of work, and the current code for the project supports as low as Windows 10 2004.
